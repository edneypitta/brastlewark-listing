Hi! This app is a page that lists gnomes from Brastlewrak town.

It's possible to list gnomes, filter by name and see the details of a gnome.

The app is deployed on Heroku. [Click here](https://brastlewark-listing.herokuapp.com/) to see it live!

## Notes

* This project uses React and was bootstrapped with Create React App
* Enzyme was used along Jest for testing
* App automatically deployed to Heroku on each push to master

## Running the application locally

* `npm install` and `npm start` will run the application with live reload
* `npm test` runs tests

Thanks!
